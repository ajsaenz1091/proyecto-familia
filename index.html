              <p> The world is a magnificent place. It makes our experience of existence possible. It receives us when we're born, and it sees us leave when we die. In between life and death, it keeps our feet on the ground with gravity and grants us countless landscapes to have adventures and learn from everything we come in contact with. The planet earth has all the characteristics of any paradise ever described, yet, we managed to hide it underneath buildings, roads, and piles of trash. Today our social, political, and economic systems have messed with the balance of the one system that we didn't help creating but that it is so crucial for the existence of all those human-made systems mentioned before. You and I know we can't rely on world power-holders to do what is required. Those generations are already at the end of their road and all they care for is maintaining their little bubble stable until their time is up. It is up to us, the awaken ones to take over and do what's necessary. This requires change, and change always meats resistance, but those roads are usually more exciting. The memories and experiences that come from challenging reality could be very rewarding. They can be painful too, but the alternative is extinction. So now that you are here, why don't we walk this road together.</p>
              <p> The Conscious Evolution Project tries to do what its name says. Evolution happens to everything, always, evolution is nothing but transformation caused by the feedback of one or more things interacting with each other. For a long time evolution has been something that has been happening to us, but today we are different creatures. We humans are more aware of our experience of existence today than ever before. We can see the nonsense of our system. We can also see that it is time for a change, time to evolve and become what the planet is signaling us to become. We can evolve consciously. It's time to fix the place, let's clean our oceans and rivers. Let's give some land back to animals, we can share the place and continue being amazed by animals. Let's work less and live more. Let's grow food again. Let's have enough time to go back to nature in a modern way. Not only we can do this, but we have to. Remember, the alternative is extinction. Do you have anything else to do other than dying? Work maybe? haha. I'm sorry you have been so abused your whole life that you can't see that others have been pushing you into slavery telling you that work creates character and that it is your responsibility to give away more than 50% of your life so that others can have a better and more enjoyable one. Work does create character but not the kind of work you've been told. It's time to live better and I mean all of us!</p>

              <h2>Are you ready to evolve?</h2>

              <p> The project is <em>YOU!<em> and we're just sharing alternatives with you so that you can find something you can fall in love with and start implementing it. choose your project and begin a road of feedback that will enlighten you. Evolution starts now!<em></p>

            <div class="work-experience">
              <h3 class="h5 date-title">Pollution</h3>
              

              <p>It is no surprise to anyone that we pollute. Water, dirt, air all polluted. All basic things we need to be healthy are full of contaminants, so the challenge is coming up with ways to clean those three elements.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="work-experience">
              <h3 class="h5 date-title">Mass extinction of species</h3>
              
              <p>It's ironic how we always thought extinction would happen to us and not because of us. Today we know extinction is happening as we speak. Coordinating with everyone so that we can all support each other in the task of saving the world will be difficult but not impossible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="work-experience">
              <h3 class="h5 date-title">Climate Change</h3>
              
              <p>The unpopular Climate Change! We have to be honest with ourselves for once in our life. We don't need experts to show tell us the changes that we have seen happening in our birthplaces. We notice how the air feels different, there aren't as many animals as when you were a kid, it feels hotter or perhaps cooler. We are all born to die, and so you might think you don't want this kind of responsibility, you just want to live well. We also want you to have a good life, one full of purpose and love, not fear and anger. Becoming heroes will be a challenge, and challenges are meant to be overcome.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="work-experience">
              <h3 class="h5 date-title">Death</h3>
              
              <p> Death is certainly scary. We avoid thinking about it every day by going to work or entertaining us in many other ways. But death is always there, not as a threat but as a wise master. If we choose to see the master, we can live better. I can not say for sure if you will live longer but I can promise you will live better. The challenge is to be ok with death, and not scared and paralyzed by it. I know it is scary but give death a chance to show you how to live better. </p>
